# Privacy Guardian

A lightweight Chrome extension that helps non-technical users see and understand third-party tracking on websites they visit. Privacy Guardian is 100% local, with no external servers, focusing on awareness rather than heavy blocking.

## Features

- **Tracker Detection**: Identifies third-party requests and cookies using Chrome's webRequest API
- **Visual Dashboard**: Clean, minimal popup interface showing:
  - Number of trackers detected on the current site
  - Types of data involved (cookies)
  - Categorized list of trackers (Analytics, Advertising, Social Media)
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally - no data leaves your browser
- **Optional Blocking**: Toggle to block trackers on specific sites
- **Known Tracker Database**: Uses a simplified version of common tracker lists

## How It Works
